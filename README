WARNING: must not be used for operational flight purposes unless
you manually check *everything* this program produces.

I will not be held legally or morally responsible for any problems
that occur as a result of using this program.

I have not tested this program sufficiently. Even if it is not broken at
the moment, future changes could break it.

Hopefully I will be able to add testing structure to try and ensure
results will always be accurate, but even this this warning still
applies.

If you find any bugs please let me know.
